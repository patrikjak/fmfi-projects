we went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back toward the end of the widow's garden stooping down so as the branches wouldn't scrape our heads when we was passing by the kitchen i fell over a root and made a noise we scrouched down and laid still miss watson's big nigger named jim was setting in the kitchen door we could see him pretty clear because there was a light behind him he got up and stretched his neck out about a minute listening then he says
who dah
he listened some more then he came tiptoeing down and stood right between us we could 'a' touched him nearly well likely it was minutes and minutes that there warn't a sound and we all there so close together there was a place on my ankle that got to itching but i dasn't scratch it and then my ear begun to itch and next my back right between my shoulders seemed like i'd die if i couldn't scratch well i've noticed that thing plenty times since if you are with the quality or at a funeral or trying to go to sleep when you ain't sleepyif you are anywheres where it won't do for you to scratch why you will itch all over in upward of a thousand places pretty soon jim says
say who is you whar is you dog my cats ef i didn' hear sumf'n well i know what i's gwyne to do i's gwyne to set down here and listen tell i hears it ag'in
so he set down on the ground betwixt me and tom he leaned his back up against a tree and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine my nose begun to itch it itched till the tears come into my eyes but i dasn't scratch then it begun to itch on the inside next i got to itching underneath i didn't know how i was going to set still this miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes but it seemed a sight longer than that i was itching in eleven different places now i reckoned i couldn't stand it more'n a minute longer but i set my teeth hard and got ready to try just then jim begun to breathe heavy next he begun to snoreand then i was pretty soon comfortable again
tom he made a sign to mekind of a little noise with his mouthand we went creeping away on our hands and knees when we was ten foot off tom whispered to me and wanted to tie jim to the tree for fun but i said no he might wake and make a disturbance and then they'd find out i warn't in then tom said he hadn't got candles enough and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more i didn't want him to try i said jim might wake up and come but tom wanted to resk it so we slid in there and got three candles and tom laid five cents on the table for pay then we got out and i was in a sweat to get away but nothing would do tom but he must crawl to where jim was on his hands and knees and play something on him i waited and it seemed a good while everything was so still and lonesome
as soon as tom was back we cut along the path around the garden fence and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house tom said he slipped jim's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him and jim stirred a little but he didn't wake afterward jim said the witches bewitched him and put him in a trance and rode him all over the state and then set him under the trees again and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it and next time jim told it he said they rode him down to new orleans and after that every time he told it he spread it more and more till by and by he said they rode him all over the world and tired him most to death and his back was all over saddleboils jim was monstrous proud about it and he got so he wouldn't hardly notice the other niggers niggers would come miles to hear jim tell about it and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over same as if he was a wonder niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things jim would happen in and say hm what you know 'bout witches and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat jim always kept that fivecenter piece round his neck with a string and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it but he never told what it was he said to it niggers would come from all around there and give jim anything they had just for a sight of that fivecenter piece but they wouldn't touch it because the devil had had his hands on it jim was most ruined for a servant because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches
well when tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling where there was sick folks maybe and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine and down by the village was the river a whole mile broad and awful still and grand we went down the hill and found joe harper and ben rogers and two or three more of the boys hid in the old tanyard so we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half to the big scar on the hillside and went ashore
we went to a clump of bushes and tom made everybody swear to keep the secret and then showed them a hole in the hill right in the thickest part of the bushes then we lit the candles and crawled in on our hands and knees we went about two hundred yards and then the cave opened up tom poked about amongst the passages and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you wouldn't 'a' noticed that there was a hole we went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room all damp and sweaty and cold and there we stopped tom says
now we'll start this band of robbers and call it tom sawyer's gang everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath and write his name in blood everybody was willing so tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on and read it it swore every boy to stick to the band and never tell any of the secrets and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it and he mustn't eat and he mustn't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts which was the sign of the band and nobody that didn't belong to the band could use that mark and if he did he must be sued and if he done it again he must be killed and if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets he must have his throat cut and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around and his name blotted off the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever
everybody said it was a real beautiful oath and asked tom if he got it out of his own head he said some of it but the rest was out of piratebooks and robberbooks and every gang that was hightoned had it
some thought it would be good to kill the families of boys that told the secrets tom said it was a good idea so he took a pencil and wrote it in then ben rogers says
here's huck finn he hain't got no family what you going to do 'bout him
well hain't he got a father says tom sawyer
yes he's got a father but you can't never find him these days he used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard but he hain't been seen in these parts for a year or more
they talked it over and they was going to rule me out because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill or else it wouldn't be fair and square for the others well nobody could think of anything to doeverybody was stumped and set still i was most ready to cry but all at once i thought of a way and so i offered them miss watsonthey could kill her everybody said
oh she'll do that's all right huck can come in
then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with and i made my mark on the paper
now says ben rogers what's the line of business of this gang
nothing only robbery and murder tom said
but who are we going to robhouses or cattle or
stuff stealing cattle and such things ain't robbery it's burglary says tom sawyer we ain't burglars that ain't no sort of style we are highwaymen we stop stages and carriages on the road with masks on and kill the people and take their watches and money
must we always kill the people
oh certainly it's best some authorities think different but mostly it's considered best to kill themexcept some that you bring to the cave here and keep them till they're ransomed
ransomed what's that
i don't know but that's what they do i've seen it in books and so of course that's what we've got to do
but how can we do it if we don't know what it is
why blame it all we've got to do it don't i tell you it's in the books do you want to go to doing different from what's in the books and get things all muddled up
oh that's all very fine to say tom sawyer but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we don't know how to do it to themthat's the thing i want to get at now what do you reckon it is
well i don't know but per'aps if we keep them till they're ransomed it means that we keep them till they're dead
now that's something like that'll answer why couldn't you said that before we'll keep them till they're ransomed to death and a bothersome lot they'll be tooeating up everything and always trying to get loose
how you talk ben rogers how can they get loose when there's a guard over them ready to shoot them down if they move a peg
a guard well that is good so somebody's got to set up all night and never get any sleep just so as to watch them i think that's foolishness why can't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here
because it ain't in the books sothat's why now ben rogers do you want to do things regular or don't youthat's the idea don't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what's the correct thing to do do you reckon you can learn 'em anything not by a good deal no sir we'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way
all right i don't mind but i say it's a fool way anyhow say do we kill the women too
well ben rogers if i was as ignorant as you i wouldn't let on kill the women no nobody ever saw anything in the books like that you fetch them to the cave and you're always as polite as pie to them and by and by they fall in love with you and never want to go home any more
well if that's the way i'm agreed but i don't take no stock in it mighty soon we'll have the cave so cluttered up with women and fellows waiting to be ransomed that there won't be no place for the robbers but go ahead i ain't got nothing to say
little tommy barnes was asleep now and when they waked him up he was scared and cried and said he wanted to go home to his ma and didn't want to be a robber any more
so they all made fun of him and called him crybaby and that made him mad and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets but tom give him five cents to keep quiet and said we would all go home and meet next week and rob somebody and kill some people
ben rogers said he couldn't get out much only sundays and so he wanted to begin next sunday but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on sunday and that settled the thing they agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could and then we elected tom sawyer first captain and joe harper second captain of the gang and so started home
i clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking my new clothes was all greased up and clayey and i was dogtired
